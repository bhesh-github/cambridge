                The IELTS exam is a requirement for international individuals
                seeking to pursue education or employment in an English-speaking
                country. It is widely accepted in countries like the UK,
                Australia, New Zealand, the United States, and Canada for
                university admissions. The primary focus of the exam is to
                evaluate candidates' proficiency in listening, reading,
                speaking, and writing in English.

                There are two variants of the IELTS test:{" "}
                <span className="txt-highlight">Academic</span> and{" "}
                <span className="txt-highlight">General Training</span> . While
                the Listening and Speaking sections are the same for both, the
                Reading and Writing sections vary depending on the specific test
                chosen by the candidate. Test-takers have the option to take the
                IELTS exam either on paper or electronically, depending on their
                preference. The validity of the test score is two years from the
                date of the exam.
