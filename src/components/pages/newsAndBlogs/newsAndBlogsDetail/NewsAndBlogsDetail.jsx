            <h5 className="sub-title">Choosing the Right Destination</h5>
            <p>
              Before diving into the visa application process, it's crucial to
              decide where you want to study. Consider factors like the quality
              of education, cost of living, language, culture, and your career
              goals. Each country may have slightly different visa requirements,
              so your destination will impact the specific steps you need to
              follow.

              Selecting the Right Course and Institution
            </h5>
            <p>
              Once you've chosen a destination, it's time to pick the right
              course and educational institution. Verify that your chosen course
              is eligible for a student visa in your chosen country.
              Furthermore, check if the institution is accredited and recognized
              by the relevant authorities.

            <h5 className="sub-title">Understanding Visa Types</h5>
            <p>
              Student visas come in various types, depending on the country. For
              example, the United States has the F-1 visa, while the United
              Kingdom offers the Tier 4 (General) visa. It's essential to
              understand the type of visa you need for your specific course and
              institution.

            <h5 className="sub-title">Financial Planning</h5>

              Most countries require students to prove they have sufficient
              funds to cover their tuition fees, living expenses, and other
              costs. You may need to provide bank statements, scholarship
              letters, or financial guarantees. Be sure to understand the
              financial requirements for your chosen destination.
